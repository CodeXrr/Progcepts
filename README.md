-------=[ Progcepts ]=------------------
POC code to show how things work conceptually. It can be direct implemntations,
or deal strictly with program design. For example, multi-file-prog will be a simpleprogram that shows the structure of a multi-file prog is implemented. Direct implementation however, may show the logic of a function. 

This is like a scratch-pad for diffrent programming skills that could be used in the future. Doing such will also help to break programs down to reusable componets.
